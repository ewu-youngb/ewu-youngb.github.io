	<h1>About Myself</h1>
	<p> Hello, and welcome!  My name is Brandon Young.  I am currently graduating (with honors) from Eastern Washington University with a bachelors of science in computer science, which took me roughly six years to complete.  My dream is to work for myself, programming applications and games for PC and mobile devices.  After graduation I plan on finding work local to the Spokane area and acquiring a few years experience in industry with a good computer hardware/software development company.      </p>
	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>I love electronics, and always have.  Growing up in the early 1980's, I recall playing with crude hand held electronic gadgets by today's standards, yet they were amazing at the time, and kept me entertained indefinitely.  I played around on my first PC in 1988, a somewhat dated 80x86 at ~5Mhz, it required you to boot DOS with a floppy, then switch floppy disks to whichever app/game you wanted to run.  It, was also amazing.  In 1992 I got my first PC, it was a Intel 486 SX 25Mhz with 4MB of RAM, 120MB HardDrive, 640x480 color display, 2400 baud modem, featuring DOS 5.0 and Windows 3.1.  I broke and fixed that computer over 100 times in the course of 3 years.  I added hardware (RAM, CD-ROM, 800MB HardDrive, sound card, video card), upgraded the CPU to a 83MHz Pentium (overdrive chip), upgraded the modem to 14.4k and spent countless hours fiddling with the config.sys and autoexec.bat files in order to have enough free memory to play games.  There really wasn't a public internet at the time, so to play PC games with friends, you had to make one PC dial your friends PC's phone number, and they had to have it set to answer incomming phonecalls.  After some magic computer tones, you were connected at 14400 baud (1750 Bytes/s, which was pretty fast at the time), and were able to blast your best friend at a game of DOOM, at least until someone called the phone and the connection was interrupted thanks to call waiting.  When I began high-school, the only computer class that was offered was keyboarding.  By my senior year they had added an experimental HTML course, which I eagerly signed up for with the other nerds.  I didn't learn much, the class was new, the teacher wasn't especially knowledgeable about computers, but it was awesome.  After high-school I fiddled around some with scripting and taught myself quite a bit.  I knew I wanted to attend a university for computers, but for whatever reason life took me a different direction.  When I was 29, I began my computer science degree at EWU.  I learned to program for real.  They taught us programming fundamentals, algorithms, data structures, hardware design, circuits and digital logic, design patterns, and slew of programming languages.  Now its time to put all this into motion, and maybe make some money in the process of doing something that I have literally, wanted to do, forever.  </p>
